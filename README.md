# VR Research

During the Summer '23 semester, I took UW-Madison's CS579/DS579 course on Virtual Reality with [Ross Tredinnick](https://wid.wisc.edu/people/ross-tredinnick/). I had a lot of fun and I ended up creating a final project evaluating four different approaches for VR applications to induce meditative states in their users.

After the summer, I joined the Virtual Environment Group for the Fall semester and continued researching at the intersection of VR and meditation. This time, I explored embodiment and Non-Dual Awareness (NDA), and the ability of a VR application to change the user's felt body size as a means towards revealing NDA or inducing meditative states.
