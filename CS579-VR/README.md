# CS579 - Virtual Reality

Over the course of the summer '23 semester, I took UW-Madison's course on virtual reality. I learned a lot about the history, tech, and research methods of VR. For my final project, I surveyed four different methods for inducing meditative states in the user of a VR application.

The final version of the project involved a VR application for viewing 3D videos. The end result was quite something to experience first-hand. Please check out the final presentation and make sure to click on the links to see the videos of each of the four methods, especially the last one.

Technologies Used:

- Unity 2021.3.24
- Oculus Integration Package
- Render Textures onto a skybox
- Vimeo as a streaming solution
